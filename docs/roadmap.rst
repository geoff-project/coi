Roadmap
=========

This page lists features that have been considered desirable for the Geoff
project and which are either being worked on or which will (at *some* point) be
worked on. As an open-source project, Geoff welcomes any external
contributions, so please feel free to reach out to the maintainers if you'd
like to see one of these features implemented!

Optimization:

- multi-objective optimization with support for PyMoo_ (or possibly DEAP_?)
- more comprehensive support for Bayesian optimization; support for Botorch_
- using recorded optimization runs to bootstrap a Bayesian optimizer
- better support for `Stable Baselines 3`_

Infrastructure:

- Configurable API based on Pydantic_ with less boilerplate and more
  declarative restrictions on the valid inputs
- plugin support for custom widgets in Configurable API
- support for recording, saving and loading optimization runs
- support for reloading specific points in an optimization run
- Memento_ API to restore initial or other points
- GUI independent of `CERN-specific widgets <accwidgets_>`_
- official publication
