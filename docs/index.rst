Common Optimization Interfaces
==============================

CERN ML is the project of bringing numerical optimization, machine learning and
reinforcement learning to the operation of the CERN accelerator complex.

CERNML-COI defines common interfaces that facilitate using numerical
optimization and reinforcement learning (RL) on the same optimization problems.
This makes it possible to unify both approaches into a generic optimization
application in the CERN Control Center.

The :doc:`cernml-coi-utils <utils:index>` package provides many additional
features that complement the COIs.
