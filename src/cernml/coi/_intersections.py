"""These protocols are intersections of various types of problems.

An `intersection protocol`_ indicates that a type implements all
protocols that are part of the intersection. Taking for example
`OptEnv`, an intersection of `~.coi.SingleOptimizable` and `~.coi.Env`,
you can shorten your line of base classes:

    >>> from gymnasium.spaces import Box
    >>> from gymnasium import Env
    >>> from cernml import coi
    ...
    >>> class Both(coi.OptEnv):
    ...     def __init__(self, render_mode=None):
    ...         super().__init__(render_mode)
    ...         self.optimization_space = Box(-1, 1)
    ...         self.observation_space = Box(-1, 1)
    ...         self.action_space = Box(-1, 1)
    ...
    ...     def get_initial_params(self): ...
    ...
    ...     def compute_single_objective(self, params): ...
    ...
    >>> env = Both()
    >>> isinstance(env, coi.SingleOptimizable)
    True
    >>> isinstance(env, Env)
    True
    >>> isinstance(env, coi.OptEnv)
    True

Vice versa, you can use intersection protocols to test if a class
implements both protocols, even if it doesn't directly subclass the
intersection protocol:

    >>> class Indirect(Env, coi.SingleOptimizable):
    ...     def __init__(self, render_mode=None):
    ...         super().__init__(render_mode)
    ...         self.optimization_space = Box(-1, 1)
    ...         self.observation_space = Box(-1, 1)
    ...         self.action_space = Box(-1, 1)
    ...
    ...     def get_initial_params(self): ...
    ...
    ...     def compute_single_objective(self, params): ...
    ...
    >>> env = Indirect()
    >>> isinstance(env, coi.SingleOptimizable)
    True
    >>> isinstance(env, Env)
    True
    >>> isinstance(env, coi.OptEnv)
    True

The intersection protocols of this package come with a few limitations
given by the implementation:

- Implementors must be real subclasses of one of the environment
  base classes (`~gymnasium.Env` or one of the :doc:`sep_goal_env`), be
  it direct or indirect. :term:`Virtual subclasses <abstract base
  class>` are not recognized.

  This restriction is given by `~gymnasium.Env` not actually being
  a `Protocol`; accordingly, it does not apply to
  `~.coi.SingleOptimizable`.

- Static type checkers like MyPy_ generally don't recognize the
  intersections as true protocols, even though they behave as such at
  runtime. Again, this is a limitation of `~gymnasium.Env` not actually
  being a `Protocol`.

- Implementor *classes* that *don't subclass* an intersection protocol
  must provide all three spaces [#spaces]_ as :term:`attributes
  <attribute>` or `properties <property>` at class scope to be
  recognized as subclasses. Type annotations are not sufficient.

  This restriction is given by the fact that for protocols,
  :func:`issubclass()` only checks the type hints of a subclass if the
  subclass is itself a protocol. If the subclass is concrete (i.e. not
  a protocol) and also doesn't have a protocol among its bases, there is
  no way for Python to verify the implementation.

- Implementor *instances*, on the other hand, merely need to *define*
  the three spaces [#spaces]_. This may happen e.g. within
  :meth:`~object.__init__()`. This may lead to the situation that
  a class ``MyEnv`` is not a *subclass* of `OptEnv`, but ``MyEnv()`` is
  an *instance* of it. This is simply given by the dynamic nature of
  Python.

.. [#spaces]
    These spaces are `~.coi.SingleOptimizable.optimization_space`,
    `~gymnasium.Env.observation_space` and
    `~gymnasium.Env.action_space`.
