class Problem(AttrCheckProtocol, t.Protocol):
    """Root protocol for all optimization problems.

    Do not not directly subclass this protocol. Instead, derive from one
    of its subclasses like `~gym.Env` or `SingleOptimizable`. This class
    exists for two purposes:

    - define which parts of the interfaces are common to all of them;
    - provide an easy way to test whether an interface is compatible
      with the generic optimization framework.

    This is a `~typing.Protocol`. This means even classes that don't
    inherit from it may be considered a subclass. To be considered
    a subclass, a class must merely:

    - provide the methods `render()`, `close()` and
      `get_wrapper_attr()`;
    - provide a dynamic property `unwrapped`;
    - provide the attributes `render_mode` and `spec`.

    Attributes:
        metadata: Capabilities and behavior of this problem.

            This must be a class-level constant attribute. It must be a
            mapping with string-type keys. Instances must not
            dynamically modify or overwrite this dict. It communicates
            fundamental properties of the class and how a host
            application can use it.

            The following keys are defined and understood by this
            package:

            ``"render.modes"``
                The render modes that the optimization problem
                understands. Standard render modes are documented under
                `render()`.
            ``"cern.machine"``
                The accelerator that an optimization problem is
                associated with. This must be a value of type `Machine`.
            ``"cern.japc"``
                A boolean flag indicating that the problem's constructor
                expects an argument named *japc* of type
                :class:`~pyjapc.PyJapc`. Enable it if your class
                performs any machine communication via JAPC. Do not
                create your own :class:`~pyjapc.PyJapc` instance. Among
                other things, this ensures that the correct timing
                selector is set.
            ``"cern.cancellable"``
                A boolean flag indicating that the problem's constructor
                expects an argument named *cancellation_token* of type
                `~cernml.coi.cancellation.Token`. Enable it if your
                class ever enters any long-running loops that the user
                may want to interrupt. A classic example is the
                acquisition and validation of cycle-bound data.

            Additionally, all keys that start with ``"cern."`` are
            reserved for future use.

        The set of supported modes varies. Some problems do not support
        rendering at all. The following modes have a standardized
        meaning:

        ``"human"``
            Render to the current display or terminal and return
            nothing. Usually for human consumption. Valid
            implementations open a Matplotlib or Pyglet window and
            return immediately.
        ``"rgb_array"``
            Return an numpy.ndarray with shape ``(x, y, 3)``,
            representing RGB values for an *x*-by-*y* pixel image,
            suitable for turning into a video.
        ``"ansi"``
            Return a `str` or `io.StringIO` containing a terminal-style
            text representation. The text can include newlines and ANSI
            escape sequences (e.g. for colors).
        ``"matplotlib_figures"``
            Render to one or more :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure`
            objects. This should return all figures whose contents have
            changed. The following return types are allowed:

            - a single :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure` object;
            - an iterable of bare :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure`
              objects or 2-tuples of `str` and
              :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure` or both;
            - a mapping with `str` keys and
              :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure` values.

            Strings are interpreted as window titles for their
            associated figure.

        Example:

            >>> from gymnasium import Env
            >>> class MyEnv(Env):
            ...     metadata = {'render.modes': ['human', 'rgb_array']}

            ...             return np.array(...)
            ...         if mode == 'human':
            ...             # Pop up a window and render.
            ...             pyplot.plot(...)
            ...             pyplot.show()

            ...         # just raise an exception
            ...         return super().render(mode)

        Note:
            Make sure to declare all modes that you support in the
            ``"render.modes"`` key of your `metadata`. It's recommended
            to call `super` in implementations to use the functionality
            of this method.

    Subclassing this :term:`abstract base class` instead of `Problem`

    - an `~object.__init__()` method that ensures that the `render_mode`
      attribute is set correctly;
    - :term:`context manager` methods that ensure that `close()` is
      called when using the problem in a :keyword:`with` statement;
    - the attribute `~HasNpRandom.np_random` as an exclusive and
      seedable `~numpy.random` number generator.

    dedicated function `is_problem()`. Alternatively, you may also call
    ``isinstance(obj.unwrapped, Problem)``. Do not use this class for
    such checks!
