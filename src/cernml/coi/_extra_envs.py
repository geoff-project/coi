    This interface is superficially similar to `GoalEnv`, but doesn't
    pose any requirements to the observation space. (By contrast,
    `.GoalEnv` requires that the observation space is a dict with keys
    ``"observation"``, ``"desired_goal"`` and ``"achieved_goal"``.) The
    only requirement is that the calculation of observation, reward and
    end-of-episode can be separated into distinct steps.

    This makes two things possible:

    - replacing `compute_observation()` with a function approximator,
      e.g. a neural network;
    - estimating the goodness of the very initial observation of an
      episode via ``env.compute_reward(env.reset(), None, {})``.

    Because of these use cases, all state transition should be
    restricted to `compute_observation()`. In particular, it must be
    possible to call `compute_reward()`, `compute_terminated()` and
    `compute_truncated()` multiple times without changing the internal
    state of the environment.
