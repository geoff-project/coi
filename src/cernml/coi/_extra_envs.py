    """An environment whose calculations nicely separate.

    This interface is superficially similar to `~gym.GoalEnv`, but
    doesn't pose any requirements to the observation space. (By
    contrast, `~gym.GoalEnv` requires that the observation space is a
    dict with keys ``"observation"``, ``"desired_goal"`` and
    ``"achieved_goal"``.) The only requirement is that the calculation
    of observation, reward and end-of-episode can be separated into
    distinct steps.

    This makes two things possible:

    - replacing `compute_observation()` with a function approximator,
      e.g. a neural network;
    - estimating the goodness of the very initial observation of an
      episode via ``env.compute_reward(env.reset(), None, {})``.

    Because of these use cases, all state transition should be
    restricted to `compute_observation()`. In particular, it must be
    possible to call `compute_reward()` and `compute_done()` multiple
    times without changing the internal state of the environment.
