    This interface is superficially similar to `~gym.GoalEnv`, but
    additionally also splits out the calculation of the observation and
    the end-of-episode flag. This class differs from `SeparableEnv` in
    the meaning of the parameters that are passed to
    `~gym.GoalEnv.compute_reward()`.

    The split introduced by this class makes two things possible:

    - replacing `compute_observation()` with a function approximator,
      e.g. a neural network;
    - estimating the goodness of the very initial observation of an
      episode via `~gym.GoalEnv.compute_reward()`.

    Because of these use cases, all state transition should be
    restricted to `compute_observation()`. In particular, it must be
    possible to call `gym.GoalEnv.compute_reward()` and `compute_done()`
    multiple times without changing the internal state of the
    environment.
