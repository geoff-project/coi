    """Extension of `typing.Protocol` to check attributes and classmethods.

    Subclassing `AttrCheckProtocol` is largely the same as subclassing
    `~typing.Protocol` directly. However, when creating
    a `~typing.runtime_checkable` protocol using `AttrCheckProtocol`, it
    will work with `issubclass()` *even if* your protocol defines
    attributes, properties or class methods.

    Protocol members are collected in the same way as in Python 3.12+,
    meaning at class creation time. You can monkey-patch a protocol with
    additional methods or attributes, but those will not be considered
    in the `isinstance()` and `issubclass()` checks.

    The `isinstance()` check aligns with Python 3.12+. However, for each
    protocol member that is a `@classmethod`, it additionally tests that
    the class of the tested instance provides a `classmethod` as well.
    Properties and normal functions are rejected.

    Checks with `issubclass()` work even if the protocol defines
    non-method members. Protocol classmethods are tested similarly to
    `isinstance()` checks, except on the subclass directly (and not on
    its metaclass).

    Checks with `issubclass()` for regular protocol methods are stricter
    than for `typing.Protocol`. Not only must the subclass have an
    attribute of the same name, it must also be callable (like for
    `isinstance()` checks).

    Just like with `typing.Protocol`, checks with `issubclass()` may
    also be satisfied if the tested subclass is itself a protocol and
    contains an *annotation* with the same name as a protocol attribute.
    Classmethods are treated like other attributes here.

    Examples:

        >>> from typing import Any, runtime_checkable
        ...
        >>> @runtime_checkable
        ... class MyProtocol(AttrCheckProtocol):
        ...     def meth(self): pass
        ...     @classmethod
        ...     def c_meth(cls): pass
        ...     attr: dict[str, Any]
        ...

    Other objects must at least contain the specified attributes to
    implement the protocol:

        >>> class Good:
        ...     def meth(self): pass
        ...     @classmethod
        ...     def c_meth(cls): pass
        ...     attr = {}
        ...
        >>> isinstance(Good(), MyProtocol)
        True
        >>> issubclass(Good, MyProtocol)
        True
        >>> isinstance(1, MyProtocol)
        False
        >>> issubclass(int, MyProtocol)
        False

    A regular method in place of a classmethod is rejected:

        >>> class Bad:
        ...     def meth(self): pass
        ...     def c_meth(self): pass
        ...     attr = {}
        ...
        >>> isinstance(Bad(), MyProtocol)
        False
        >>> issubclass(Bad, MyProtocol)
        False
