"""The dimly lit machine room of the COI.

The :doc:`classes` all share the same special behavior: they can be
superclasses of other classes even if those other classes don't directly
inherit from them. All that is necessary is that those classes provide
certain members as determined by the core class in question. Crucially,
this check works at runtime and takes into account whether a member is
a regular attribute, a method or a `classmethod`.

The core classes don't implement this check themselves. Instead, they
rely on a number of pure, stateless protocols, one for each of the core
classes. These :doc:`protocols` are based on the standard-library
features `typing.Protocol` and `typing.runtime_checkable`. However, the
standard library prohibits runtime checks for non-method members, which
our classes all do.

Our protocols allow this because our protocols are a special kind of
protocols. They inherit from `AttrCheckProtocol`, a subclass of
`Protocol` that extends runtime checks with the above two capabilities.
The purpose of this page is to describe how exactly this extension has
been implemented.

The first section documents the :ref:`api/machinery:Classes Provided by
This Module` as a public API of this private module. The following
section describes the :ref:`api/machinery:Attribute-Matching Logic` in
detail. After this, several :ref:`api/machinery:Compatibility Shims` are
described that ensure that this module works on all Python versions
starting from 3.9. Following this, :ref:`api/machinery:Utilities and
Dark Magic` documents a few particularly obscure hacks. Finally, we
conclude with notes on various tricky implementation details surrounding
:ref:`api/machinery:The Instance Check of ABCMeta`,
:ref:`api/machinery:The Subclass Hook of the Core Classes`, and
:ref:`api/machinery:The Implementation of Intersection Protocols`.

    """Base class for protocols that check attributes and class methods.

    Subclassing `AttrCheckProtocol` is largely the same as subclassing
    `Protocol` directly. However, when creating
    a `runtime_checkable` protocol using `AttrCheckProtocol`, it
    will work with :func:`issubclass()` *even if* your protocol defines
    attributes, properties or class methods.

    Note:
        Due to limitations in type checkers like MyPy, it might be
        necessary that your protocols subclass both `AttrCheckProtocol`
        and `Protocol` directly in order to be recognized as protocols.
        This has no impact on runtime behavior.

    Protocol members are collected in the **same way as in Python
    3.12+**, meaning: at class creation time. You may monkey-patch
    a protocol with additional methods or attributes after class
    creation, but those members will not be considered in
    :func:`isinstance()` and :func:`issubclass()` checks.

    The :func:`isinstance()` check mostly aligns with Python 3.12+,
    meaning: it is based on :func:`~inspect.getattr_static()` and might
    not find dynamically generated attributes. However, for each
    protocol member that is a `classmethod`, it additionally tests that
    the class of the tested instance provides a `classmethod` of that
    name as well. Properties and normal functions are rejected.

    Checks with :func:`issubclass()` work even if the protocol defines
    non-method members. Protocol class methods are tested similarly to
    :func:`isinstance()` checks, except on the subclass directly (and
    not on its metaclass).

    Checks with :func:`issubclass()` for regular protocol methods are
    stricter than for `Protocol`. Not only must the subclass have an
    attribute of the same name, it must also be callable (like for
    :func:`isinstance()` checks).

    Just like with `Protocol`, checks with :func:`issubclass()` may
    also be satisfied if the tested subclass is itself a protocol and
    contains an *annotation* with the same name as a protocol attribute.
    Class methods are treated like other attributes here.

    Examples:

        >>> from typing import Any, runtime_checkable
        ...
        >>> @runtime_checkable
        ... class MyProtocol(AttrCheckProtocol):
        ...     def meth(self): pass
        ...     @classmethod
        ...     def c_meth(cls): pass
        ...     attr: dict[str, Any]
        ...

    Other objects must at least contain the specified attributes to
    implement the protocol:

        >>> class Good:
        ...     def meth(self): pass
        ...     @classmethod
        ...     def c_meth(cls): pass
        ...     attr = {}
        ...
        >>> isinstance(Good(), MyProtocol)
        True
        >>> issubclass(Good, MyProtocol)
        True
        >>> isinstance(1, MyProtocol)
        False
        >>> issubclass(int, MyProtocol)
        False

    A regular method in place of a class method is rejected:

        >>> class Bad:
        ...     def meth(self): pass
        ...     def c_meth(self): pass
        ...     attr = {}
        ...
        >>> isinstance(Bad(), MyProtocol)
        False
        >>> issubclass(Bad, MyProtocol)
        False

    Attributes:
        _is_protocol (bool): Flag that indicates whether a subclass of
            `Protocol` is itself a protocol or a concrete class.
            `Protocol` determines its value in
            `~AttrCheckProtocol.__init_subclass__()`;
            `AttrCheckProtocolMeta` pre-empts this in
            `~AttrCheckProtocolMeta.__new__()`.

        _is_runtime_protocol (bool): Flag that indicates whether
            a protocol can be used in :func:`isinstance()` and
            :func:`issubclass()` checks. This is set by
            `runtime_checkable`.

        __protocol_attrs__ (set[str]): Cached collection of all protocol
            members, no matter whether they're a nested :term:`variable
            annotation`, a :term:`method`, a `classmethod`, a `property`
            or a regular :term:`attribute`. This is set by
            `AttrCheckProtocolMeta.__init__()` if the class is
            a protocol. It doesn't exist on concrete classes (but may
            still be found via the :term:`method resolution order`).

            Both the standard library and this module have a list of
            `_SPECIAL_NAMES` that never appear here.

        __non_callable_proto_members__ (set[str]): Cached collection of
            all protocol members that are not methods, class methods or
            static methods, i.e. properties, attributes and variable
            annotations. This is set by `runtime_checkable` [#rtp]_, so
            it doesn't exist on non-runtime protocols. It is always
            a subset of `__protocol_attrs__`.

            It is also set by `non_callable_proto_members()` if it
            doesn't exist yet. This may be the case on older Python
            versions that don't know this attribute yet.

        __proto_classmethods__ (set[str]): Cached collection of all
            protocol members that are class methods. This is created
            lazily the first time `proto_classmethods()` is called.
            Thus, you always have to assume that it doesn't exist yet.

            This is always a subset of `__protocol_attrs__`. It is
            a strict invention of this module and does not interact with
            `Protocol` in any way.

    .. method:: __init__(*args, **kwargs)

        This method is provided by `Protocol` and is not our implementation.

        All subclasses that are protocols themselves have their
        :meth:`~object.__init__()` initializer replaced by a special
        dummy that prevents them from being instantiated. This
        replacement occurs inside `__init_subclass__()`. If this dummy
        gets called from a concrete class (e.g. because that concrete
        class doesn't define an initializer), it searches the MRO for
        any initializer other than itself and replaces itself with it.

        One quirk of the dummy is that if it gets called via
        :class:`super() <super>` from a concrete class that already has
        a custom initializer, it will return immediately and call
        ``super().__init__()`` itself. In some cases of multiple
        inheritance, this may break the initialization chain and leave
        an object partially uninitialized. If you run into this issue,
        we propose `filing an issue
        <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/>`_ with the CPython
        project.

    .. method:: __init_subclass__(*args, **kwargs)
        :classmethod:

        This method is provided by `Protocol` and is not our implementation.

        The :meth:`~object.__init_subclass__()` class method is called
        automatically by :class:`type.__new__() <type>` during class
        creation. (See :ref:`std:Metaclasses` for more information.) For
        protocols, it updates three attributes:

        - `_is_protocol` is set to True if the subclass inherits from
          `Protocol` *directly*, and to False otherwise. If
          `_is_protocol` is already True, it is not modified.
        - The protocol `__subclasshook__` is injected if the subclass
          doesn't have a custom :meth:`~abc.ABCMeta.__subclasshook__()`.
        - The protocol `__init__` is injected if the subclass is
          a protocol and doesn't have a custom
          :meth:`~object.__init__()`.

        The first two attributes are pre-empted by
        `AttrCheckProtocolMeta.__new__()` with our own checks. By
        setting these attributes before `Protocol` can, we can override
        them with our own logic.
