    """Root protocol for all optimization problems.

    Do not not directly subclass this protocol. Instead, derive from one
    of its subclasses like `~gym.Env` or `SingleOptimizable`. This class
    exists for two purposes:

    - define which parts of the interfaces are common to all of them;
    - provide an easy way to test whether an interface is compatible
      with the generic optimization framework.

    This is a `~typing.Protocol`. This means even classes that don't
    inherit from it may be considered a subclass. To be considered
    a subclass, a class must merely:

    - provide the methods `render()`, `close()` and
      `get_wrapper_attr()`;
    - provide a dynamic property `unwrapped`;
    - provide the attributes `render_mode` and `spec`.

    Attributes:
        metadata: Capabilities and behavior of this problem.

            This must be a class-level constant attribute. It must be a
            mapping with string-type keys. Instances must not
            dynamically modify or overwrite this dict. It communicates
            fundamental properties of the class and how a host
            application can use it.

            The following keys are defined and understood by this
            package:

            ``"render_modes"``
                The render modes that the optimization problem
                understands. Standard render modes are documented under
                `render()`.
            ``"cern.machine"``
                The accelerator that an optimization problem is
                associated with. This must be a value of type `Machine`.
            ``"cern.japc"``
                A boolean flag indicating that the problem's constructor
                expects an argument named *japc* of type
                :class:`~pyjapc.PyJapc`. Enable it if your class
                performs any machine communication via JAPC. Do not
                create your own :class:`~pyjapc.PyJapc` instance. Among
                other things, this ensures that the correct timing
                selector is set.
            ``"cern.cancellable"``
                A boolean flag indicating that the problem's constructor
                expects an argument named *cancellation_token* of type
                `~cernml.coi.cancellation.Token`. Enable it if your
                class ever enters any long-running loops that the user
                may want to interrupt. A classic example is the
                acquisition and validation of cycle-bound data.

            Additionally, all keys that start with ``"cern."`` are
            reserved for future use.

            suitable for turning into a video.
        ``"ansi"``
            Return a `str` or `io.StringIO` containing a terminal-style
            text representation. The text can include newlines and ANSI
            escape sequences (e.g. for colors).
        ``"matplotlib_figures"``
            Render to one or more :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure`
            objects. This should return all figures whose contents have

            - a single :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure` object;
            - an iterable of bare :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure`
              objects or 2-tuples of `str` and
              :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure` or both;
            - a mapping with `str` keys and
              :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure` values.

            Strings are interpreted as window titles for their
            associated figure.

    Fundamentally, an environment (described by `gym.Env`) contains a
    hidden *state* on which *actions* can be performed. Each action
    causes a *transition* from one state to another. Each transition
    produces an *observation* and a *reward*.

    In contrast, an *optimizable* problem has certain *parameters* that
    can be *set* to transition *into* a certain state. Each state (not
    the transition!) is associated with a *loss* that shall be
    minimized.

    The difference between actions and parameters is:

    - **actions** describe a *step* that shall be taken in the phase
      space of states;
    - **parameters** describe the *point* in phase space that shall be
      moved to.

    A parameter may be e.g. the electric current supplied to a magnet,
    and an action may be the value by which to increase or decrease that
    current.

    The difference between the parameters and the hidden state is that
    the parameters may describe only a *subset* of the state. There may
    be state variables that cannot be influenced by the optimizer.

            attribute is required.
        objective_range: Optional. Specifies the range in which the
            return value of `compute_single_objective()` will lie. The
            default is to allow any finite float value, but subclasses
            may restrict this e.g. for normalization purposes.
        objective_name: Optional. A custom name for the objective
            function. You should only set this attribute if there is a
            physical meaning to the objective. The default is not to
            attach any meaning to the objective function.
        param_names: Optional. Custom names for each of the parameters
            of the problem. If set, this list should have exactly as
            many elements as the `optimization_space`. The default is

        You should only override this method if your problem cannot be
        solved well if optimized at arbitrary skeleton points. In such a
        case, this method allows you to handle the selection of skeleton
        points in a customized fashion in your own implementation of
        `~cernml.coi.Configurable`.

        If overridden, this function should return the list of skeleton
        points at which the problem should be evaluated. As always, each
        skeleton point should be given as a floating-point time in
        milliseconds since the beginning of an acceleration cycle. For
        maximum compatibility, it is suggested not to return fractional
        cycle times.

        A host application should call this method before starting an
        optimization run. If the return value is `None`, it may
        proceed to let the user choose the skeleton points at which to
        optimize. If the return value is a list, the user should be
        allowed to review, but not modify it. In that case, the other
        methods of this class must not be called with any skeleton point
        that is not in that list.
