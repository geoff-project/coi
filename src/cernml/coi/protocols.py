"""The protocols that underlie the :doc:`classes`.

The core classes contain several convenience features that are not
relevant to the API defined by this package. For example, a class need
not have an attribute `~.coi.Problem.np_random` in order to satistfy the
`SingleOptimizable` interface. This means that the core classes
themselves are not suited to check whether an object satisfies one of
our interfaces.

Instead, this definition is done by the protocols defined in this
module. They are derived from a subclass of `typing.Protocol` and are
all `~typing.runtime_checkable`. This subclass is described in
:doc:`machinery`, but it extends the checks performed by standard
runtime-checkable protocols.

This page lists the pure protocols and their properties. Their
individual documentation is kept concise. For the full details, refer to
the :doc:`classes`.

    Ideally, this is an immutable, class-scope attribute that does not
    get replaced after the problem has been instantiated. Unfortunately,
    there are various exceptions to this:

    - Wrappers often cannot define their metadata at the class scope.
      For them, metadata only makes sense at the instance level.
    - Certain metadata items (e.g. ``"render_fps"``) may be determined
      at instantiation time by certain optimization problems. In this
      case, metadata often exists both at the class and instance scope,
      but they disagree on some items.

    So far, no optimization problem has been observed that modifies an
    existing metadata mapping. If *any* updates are necessary, it is
    considered best practice to :func:`~copy.deepcopy()` the existing
    instance, modify the copy, and then replace the original.

    The protocol defines *metadata* as a `dict` for compatibility
    reasons, but actually binds it to a `types.MappingProxyType` object.
    This is done as a safety measure, to prevent accidental overwrites
    of globally visible data.

        `gymnasium.Wrapper`, where it is not writable. However,
        implementors of this protocol are expected to replace this with
        a either a regular attribute or a writable property.

        The default implementation of this property simply looks up
        *render_mode* in the instance dict. You can set this value with
        a line like the following:
