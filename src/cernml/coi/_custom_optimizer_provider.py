    """Interface for optimization problems with custom optimizers.

    This protocol gives subclasses of `SingleOptimizable` and
    `FunctionOptimizable` the opportunity to dynamically define
    specialized optimization algorithms that are tailored to the
    problem. Host applications are expected to check the presence of
    this interface and, if possible, call `get_optimizers()` before
    presenting a list of optimization algorithms to the user. Host
    applications must also check the entry point
    :ep:`cernml.custom_optimizers` for matchin optimizer providers.

    Optimizers provided by this protocol should themselves follow the
    protocol defined by :class:`~cernml.optimizers.Optimizer`. Beware
    that that protocol is defined in a separate package, which can be
    installed with one of these lines:

    .. code-block:: shell-session

        $ pip install cernml-coi-optimizers  # The concrete package
        $ pip install cernml-coi[optimizers] # as extra of this package
        $ pip install cernml-coi[all]        # as part of all extras

    Like `Problem`, this is an :term:`std:abstract base class`. This
    means even classes that don't inherit from it may be considered
    a subclass, as long as they adhere to the interface defined by this
    class.

        The return value is a mapping from optimizer name to optimizer.
        The name should follow the format of other, registered
        optimizers and not conflict with any of their names.

        Custom optimizers with the same name may be returned by
        different optimization problems and may be different from each
        other.
