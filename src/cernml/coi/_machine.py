"""An enum of all the possible CERN accelerating machines."""

from enum import Enum


class Machine(Enum):
    """Enum of the various accelerators at CERN.

    This enum should be used by environments in their
    `~Problem.metadata` dictionary to declare which accelerator they
    pertain to. This can be used to filter a collection of environments
    for only those that are interesting to a certain group of operators.

    This list is intentionally left incomplete. If you wish to use this
    API at a machine that is not listed in this enum, please contact the
    developers to have it included.

    In the same vein, if you match a `Machine` against a list of enum
    members, you should be prepared that new machines may be added in
    the future.

        ...     return {
        ...         Machine.LINAC_2: 1.0,
        ...         Machine.LINAC_3: 4.0,
        ...         Machine.LINAC_4: 3.0,

        >>> get_proper_value_for(Machine.LINAC_4)

        >>> get_proper_value_for(Machine.ISOLDE)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        KeyError: <Machine.ISOLDE: 'ISOLDE'>

        >>> def get_proper_value_for(machine):

        ...     }.get(machine, some_reasonable_default)
        >>> get_proper_value_for(Machine.ISOLDE)
        0.0

    Of course, if there is *no* reasonable default for an unknown
    machine, raising an exception may still be your best bet.
