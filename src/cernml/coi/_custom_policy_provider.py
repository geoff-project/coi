class CustomPolicyProvider(AttrCheckProtocol, t.Protocol):
    """Interface for optimization problems with custom RL algorithms.

    This protocol gives subclasses of `~gym.Env` the opportunity to
    dynamically collect and return RL agents that are tailored to the
    problem. Host applications are expected to check the presence of
    this interface and, if possible, call `get_policy_names()` before
    presenting a list of agents to the user.

    The interface is split into two parts:

    1. `get_policy_names()` collects the list of available agents or
       policies and returns a list of names.

    2. `load_policy()` receives the name of the chosen agent or policy
       should load it.

    The object returned by `load_policy()` is expected to have a method
    `~Policy.predict()`. All algorithms and policy classes of
    :doc:`Stable Baselines <sb3:index>` satisfy this interface.

    This is an :term:`std:abstract base class`. This means even classes
    that don't inherit from it may be considered a subclass. To be
    considered a subclass, a class must merely provide
    a `std:classmethod` with the name ``get_policy_names`` and
    a *regular* method with the name ``load_policy``.

    Custom policies may also be provided through an :doc:`entry point
    <pkg:specifications/entry-points>`. Entry points in the group
    ``cernml.custom_policies`` that have the same name as the
    *registered* name of the environment (not the class name!) must
    point to a subclass of `CustomPolicyProvider`. The class must be
    instantiable by calling it without arguments. A host application may
    load and invoke such an entry point if and only if the user selects
    an optimization problem with a matching name.
