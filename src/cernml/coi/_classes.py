"""These are the most prominent classes provided by this package.

They provide an extension of the API provided by :doc:`Gymnasium
<gym:README>` and are heavily inspired by it. They are in turn:

- `~.coi.Problem`: The root of the interface hierarchy. Both the
  following two classes _and_ `.coi.Env` are subclasses of it.
- `~.coi.SingleOptimizable`: an `.coi.Env`-like class for numerical
  optimization problems;
- `~.coi.FunctionOptimizable`: A variant of `~.coi.SingleOptimizable`
  for situations where a *function* over time must be optimized
  pointwise in order. This is the case e.g. when adjusting the tune of
  a circular particle accelerator.
- `~.coi.HasNpRandom`: A mix-in class that provides a convenient
  random-number generator (RNG). Already included by `~.coi.Problem`.
- `.CustomOptimizerProvider`: An optional mix-in interface for
  optimization problems that require a specific optimization algorithm
  to be solved.

Each of these three classes is an :term:`abstract base class` (ABC). In
short, this means that they can be superclasses of other classes, even
if the latter don't inherit from them. The only requirement is that the
subclass provides the same members as the ABC. This follows and extends
the idea of structural subtyping implemented by `typing.Protocol`.

    >>> from cernml.coi import Problem
    >>> class MyClass:
    ...     metadata = {}
    ...     render_mode = None
    ...     spec = None
    ...     @property
    ...     def unwrapped(self):
    ...         return self
    ...     def close(self):
    ...         pass
    ...     def render(self):
    ...         raise NotImplementedError
    ...     def get_wrapper_attr(self, name):
    ...         return getattr(self, name)
    >>> issubclass(MyClass, Problem)
    True

In practice, you still want to subclass these ABCs because they provide
some conveniences that are bothersome to implement otherwise. See
`~.coi.Problem` for a list.

    You typically don't subclass this class directly. Instead, subclass
    one of its subclasses, e.g. `Env` or `SingleOptimizable`. This class
    exists for two purposes:

    - define which parts of the interfaces are common to all of them;
    - provide an easy way to test whether an interface is compatible
      with the generic optimization framework.

    This is an :term:`abstract base class`. This means even classes that
    don't inherit from it may be considered a subclass. To be considered
    a subclass, a class must provide:

    - the attributes `metadata`, `render_mode` and `spec`;
    - provide the methods `render()`, `close()` and
      `get_wrapper_attr()`;
    - a dynamic property `unwrapped`.

    While this is all that is necessary to be considered a subclass,
    direct inheritance provides the following additional benefits:

    - Its ``__init__()`` method requires *render_mode*, verifies it with
      the ``"render_modes"`` key of `metadata` and assigns it to the
      `render_mode` attribute. This reduces the amount of boilerplate
      code you have to write yourself.
    - It implements the :term:`context manager` protocol to
      automatically call `close()` when the user is done with a problem.
    - It provides the `np_random` property as an exclusive and lazily
      initialized random-number generator for the problem.

        The accelerator that an optimization problem is
        associated with. This must be a value of type `Machine`.
    ``"cern.japc"``
        A boolean flag indicating that the problem's constructor
        expects an argument named *japc* of type
        :class:`~pyjapc.PyJapc`. Enable it if your class
        performs any machine communication via JAPC. Do not
        create your own :class:`~pyjapc.PyJapc` instance. Among
        other things, this ensures that the correct timing

    Typically, an RL environment (described by `.Env`) contains a hidden
    *state* on which *actions* can be performed. Each *action* changes
    the *state* and produces an *observation* and a *reward*. In
    contrast, an optimization problem has certain *parameters* that can
    be *set* to given values. Each set of values (and not the transition
    between them) is associated with a *objective value* that shall be
    minimized.

    This means in short:

    - **actions** describe a *step* that shall be taken in the phase
      space of states;
    - **parameters** describe the *point* in phase space to move to.

    A parameter may be e.g. the electric current supplied to a magnet,
    and an action may be the value by which to increase or decrease that
    current. The difference between the parameters and the hidden state
    is that the parameters may describe only a *subset* of the state.
    There may be state variables that cannot be influenced by the
    optimizer.

        This function is the core of the interface. When called, it

           with the machine; this may include applying offsets, scaling

           ensure that the settings have propagated to the machine.
        4. Reduce the measurements into a scalar cost to be minimized.
           This may involve scaling, averaging over multiple variables

        This function may modify the environment, but it should
        conceptually be stateless: Calling it twice with the same
        parameters should return the same objective value plus
