"""Provide cooperative task cancellation.

Cancellation is implemented as two classes with two-way communication
between them: `TokenSource` and `Token`:

    >>> import threading, time
    >>> def loop(token: Token) -> None:
    ...     while not token.cancellation_requested:
    ...         # Something that takes a long time:
    ...         time.sleep(0.01)
    >>> source = TokenSource()
    >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=loop, args=(source.token,))
    >>> thread.start()
    >>> source.cancel()
    >>> # This line would deadlock if we had
    >>> # not sent a cancellation request.
    >>> thread.join()

Usually, it is more convenient to check the token's state with
`Token.raise_if_cancellation_requested()`:

    >>> def loop(token: Token) -> None:
    ...     while True:
    ...         token.raise_if_cancellation_requested()
    ...         # Something that takes a long time:
    ...         time.sleep(0.01)

Note that :func:`cernml.japc_utils.subscribe_stream()` supports
cancellation tokens. This makes it easy to interrupt a thread that is
waiting a long time for accelerator data.

Normally, a cancellation request cannot be undone. This is on purpose,
as cancellation might have left the task object in an unclean state.
However, the task may explicitly declare that it has cleaned itself up
after a cancellation by *completing* it. Completing a cancellation
allows the source to reset and reuse it for another cancellation.

Take this class. It reads values from some machine, but occasionally
gets stuck in an infinite loop:

    >>> class SporadicFailure:
    ...     def __init__(self, token):
    ...         self.token = token
    ...         self.next_value = 0
    ...
    ...     def get_next(self):
    ...         # We know that our class won't break if it gets
    ...         # interrupted. Hence, once we have handled a
    ...         # cancellation, we can mark it as completed.
    ...         try:
    ...             value = self.read_from_machine()
    ...             return value
    ...         except CancelledError:
    ...             self.token.complete_cancellation()
    ...             raise
    ...
    ...     def read_from_machine(self):
    ...         self.next_value += 1
    ...         # Deadlock sometimes:
    ...         if self.next_value == 2:
    ...             self.deadlock()
    ...         self.token.raise_if_cancellation_requested()
    ...         return self.next_value
    ...
    ...     def deadlock(self):
    ...         # This waits indefinitely. However, because we use a
    ...         # cancellation token, it can be interrupted.
    ...         with self.token.wait_handle:
    ...             while not self.token.cancellation_requested:
    ...                 self.token.wait_handle.wait()

We want to fetch a value from it and add it to a list. With a real
machine, this could take a while:

    >>> source = TokenSource()
    >>> receiver = SporadicFailure(source.token)
    >>> collected_data = []
    >>> collected_data.append(receiver.get_next())
    >>> collected_data
    [1]

Fetching the next value will deadlock for some reason, so we will have
to cancel it. In a real application, we would put fetching into a
background thread and cancel when the user clicks a button:

    >>> timer = threading.Timer(0.1, source.cancel)
    >>> timer.start()
    >>> collected_data.append(receiver.get_next())
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    coi.cancellation.CancelledError

However, we have a problem: If we now tried to fetch the next value, the
token would still be cancelled, so we would get another exception:

    >>> collected_data.append(receiver.get_next())
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    coi.cancellation.CancelledError

However, we are lucky, because the receiver still is in a usable state
(and is telling us as much):

    >>> source.can_reset_cancellation
    True
    >>> source.reset_cancellation()

And now we can collect data again:

    >>> collected_data.append(receiver.get_next())
    >>> collected_data
    [1, 4]

    Regular tokens start out in the `READY` state. Once the
    `TokenSource` requests cancellation, the token transitions into the
    `CANCELLING` state. If the token's holder has handled the

    transition it into the `CANCELLED` state.

    This signals to the token source that cancellation is complete and
    it may call `~TokenSource.reset_cancellation()`. This transitions
    the token back into the `READY` state. From this, a new cancellation
    can be requested.

    For convenience, the state is ordered by the above state machine::

class TokenSource:
    """Sending half of a cancellation channel.

    This half is usually created by a host application. It then sends
    the token to a `~cernml.coi.Problem` upon instantiation.

    Whenever a `~cernml.coi.Problem` enters a long-running calculation,
    it should periodically check the token for a cancellation request.
    If such a request has arrived, the problem has a chance to
    gracefully abort its calculation.

    As a convenience feature, token sources are also context managers.
    They yield their token when entering a context and automatically
    cancel it when leaving the context:

    # cancellation state is on the source and the token maintains a
    # strong reference to it. Uncancellable and always-cancelled tokens
    # are implemented by referencing static global immutable token
    # sources in the respective states.
    #
    # We don't do this for ease of implementation. In C#, all logic is
    # within the token source because of the additional complexity of
    # timers ("create a source that cancels automatically after X
    # seconds), registered actions ("call this function as soon as the
    # token is cancelled") and joined cancellation ("create a source
